# Sample Knowledge Base Document

## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

## Types of AI

### 1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)
Narrow AI is designed to perform a specific task, such as:
- Voice recognition
- Image classification
- Recommendation systems

### 2. General AI (Strong AI)
General AI would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across different domains, similar to human intelligence.

### 3. Super AI
A hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects.

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### Key Concepts:
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs like GPT, LLaMA, and others are trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text.

### LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)
- Developed by Meta
- Open-source model
- Available in various sizes (7B, 13B, 70B parameters)
- Can be run locally with tools like Ollama

## Vector Databases

Vector databases store data as high-dimensional vectors, enabling:
- Semantic search
- Similarity matching
- Efficient retrieval of related information

### Popular Vector Databases:
- Pinecone
- Weaviate
- Milvus
- Chroma

## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG combines the power of LLMs with external knowledge bases:

1. **Retrieval**: Find relevant information from a knowledge base
2. **Augmentation**: Add this information to the prompt
3. **Generation**: LLM generates a response using both its training and the retrieved context

This approach helps reduce hallucinations and provides more accurate, contextual responses.

## Applications of AI Assistants

- Customer service automation
- Personal productivity tools
- Educational tutoring
- Code assistance
- Research and analysis
- Content creation

## Best Practices

1. **Data Quality**: Ensure high-quality training data
2. **Ethical Considerations**: Address bias and fairness
3. **Privacy**: Protect user data
4. **Transparency**: Make AI decisions explainable
5. **Continuous Learning**: Update models with new information
